This is Yarn Weaver, a simple tool to help you test your Yarn scripts.\n<<endif>>\n\n<<if $apples != null and $apples > 0>>\n(You still have apples left, by the way! They're going to waste!)\n-> Sorry! (eat an apple)\n    That's more like it. <<set $apples to $apples - 1>>\n-> No thanks. (don't eat an apple)\n    Fine... but you know what they say about apples. An apple a day... something something.\nBut anyway, uh... what did you want to know?\n<<endif>>\n\n-> Tell me about the interface.\n    At the top of the screen, you'll see: a PLAY (▶) button, a REFRESH (↻) button, and a CLOSE (×) button.\n    -> The PLAY button?\n        It plays the Yarn file. You can play a Yarn file multiple times.\n    -> The REFRESH button?\n        It resets all the variables on the Yarn and reloads the file.\n    -> The CLOSE button?\n        It closes the current file.\n    Also, at the bottom of the window, you'll see a debug window.\n    This DEBUG window helps you track your variables. Look, I'll set one now:\n    <<set $apples to 5>>\n    As you can see below, I just set a variable called \"$apples\" to 5.\n-> OK, so how should I use this thing?\n    Well...\n\nOK, now...\nThe suggested workflow is this: keep Yarn open in one window, and keep this tool (YarnWeaver) open in another window.\nWhen you edit your file in Yarn, switch back into YarnWeaver and load it up.\nAfter you load a file, you can click the REFRESH button above to see your changes.\nOk, that's pretty much it. Good luck!\n-> Thanks! You too, buddy!!\n    Yeaahhhh that's the spirit!!! :) :) :) <<set $happy to $happy + 1>>\n-> Uh oh... I don't know about this...\n    Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. <<set $sad to $sad + 1>>\n-> I thought you were going to be more helpful.\n    Well, as my friend's dad would always say, \"Life is full of disappointments.\" <<set $disappoint to $disappoint +1>>\n\n<<if $apples != null and $apples > 0>>\n(Oh, and feel free to keep those apples!!!) It's my gift to you!\n<<endif>>\n\n<<if $alreadyPlayed == 1 >>\nAnd feel free to come back anytime...\n<<set $bye to \"but seriously, go make stuff now\">>\n<<else>>\nBut seriously... Bye now!\n<<set $alreadyPlayed to 1>>\n<<endif>>",
