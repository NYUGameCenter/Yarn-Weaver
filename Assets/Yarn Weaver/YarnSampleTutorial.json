This is YarnWeaver, a simple tool to help you test your Yarn scripts.\n-> Tell me about the interface.\n    At the top of the screen, you'll see: a PLAY (▶) button, a REFRESH (↻) button, and a CLOSE (×) button.\n    -> The PLAY button?\n        It plays the Yarn file. You can play a Yarn file multiple times.\n    -> The REFRESH button?\n        It resets all the variables on the Yarn and reloads the file.\n    -> The CLOSE button?\n        It closes the current file.\n    Also, at the bottom of the window, you'll see a debug window.\n    This DEBUG window helps you track your variables. Look, I'll set one now:\n    <<set $apples to 5>>\n    As you can see below, I just set a variable called \"$apples\" to 5.\n-> OK, so how should I use this thing?\n    Well...\n\nOK, now...\nThe suggested workflow is this: keep Yarn open in one window, and keep this tool (YarnWeaver) open in another window.\nWhen you edit your file in Yarn, switch back into YarnWeaver and load it up.\nAfter you load a file, you can click the REFRESH button above to see your changes.\nOk, that's pretty much it. Good luck!\n-> Thanks! You too, buddy!!\n    :) :) :)\n-> Uh, ok... I think...\n    Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.\n-> I thought this was going to be more helpful.\n    Well, as my friend's dad would always say, \"Life is full of disappointments.\"\n\nBut seriously... Bye now!",
